# contact-app
Angular Based Contact List

This Application majorly functions in -
- Fetching the Contacts data from JSON
- Displaying the data in Table View
- Deleting the Data from Table View
- Adding a new Contact in Table View

Steps to Run this Code.
1. Run npm install to install all the related dependencies.
2. Run npm run start to run the Application locally.

PS: I will update the functionality of Updating the Contacts on the fly ASAP. (Once my laptop gets charged).
